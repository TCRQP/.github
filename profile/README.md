# Theoretical and Computational Research on Quantum Physics

📍Institute of Chemistry, UNESP, Araraquara, Brazil.


Welcome to our research group! We focus on theoretical and computational approaches to quantum physics, exploring a wide range of topics, including:

- Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Information Theory
- Density Functional Theory (DFT)
- Density Functionals, Machine Learning Methods, DMRG
- Nanostructures, Nanomaterials, and Ultracold Atoms
- Entanglement, Quantum Phase Transitions, and Superconductivity

Our work involves cutting-edge numerical simulations and analytical methods to understand quantum systems at different scales, from fundamental theoretical models to applications in materials science and quantum technologies.
